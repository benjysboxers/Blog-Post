        <h1>What is webXR</h1>
        <p>To understand what webxr is firstly we will have to understand the term "xr" which itself xr is just a
            category
            for all technologies that lets one enhance the real world around you through the use of computer graphics.
            Having understood this webxr in short can be described as an API on web browsers that allows one to use
            different xr-compatible hardware to work on websites through the use of WebGL. In practicality when visiting
            a
            webpage employed with this technology you will be able to interact with 3D content regardless of the device
            you
            are on.</p>

        <h1>How WebGL works</h1>
        <p>WebGL is a javascript API out of the many APIs javascript provides, this is used for rendering
            high-performance and Interactive 3D as well as 2D graphics within any compatible browser without the usage
            of plugins. To use WebGL developers write Javascript code specific to 3D geometry, textures, and shaders
            that make up a scene. Shaders are just a small part of the program that runs on graphics hardware and is
            responsible for the computation of colors and lighting of each pixel on the screen.</p>

        <h1>Why this technology is important for the future</h1>
        <p>As we dive deeper into the technology itself, especially what we can explore with it, and continue to push
            our technological boundaries, these two technologies webGL and webxr are shaping the future of web-based
            graphics as well as virtual reality experience. With the growth of web-based graphics and virtual reality
            experiences innovating a new pathway towards different niches across the world with WebGL and WebXR
            developers can branch into more complex designs that were not normally possible with traditional 2D graphics
            and text. New implementations are constantly being added to both of these technologies such as support for
            new devices and sensors, better performance optimizations, and improved integration with other web
            technologies. This means this technology is always constantly expanding its horizons and there is always a
            constant need for innovation of newer ideas.</p>

        <h1>How to deploy webXR</h1>
        <div class="gaps">
            <p>Firstly now that we have understood that webXR is a technology and its usage of allowing developers to
                deploy
                immersive virtual and augmented virtual reality experiences via a web browser, How exactly do you deploy
                this is the question.
                <br>
                <br>

                Step 1 - Choosing a hosting provider

                The first step to deploying your WebXR application is selecting a hosting provider to handle the files
                and
                assets of your application and that also supports HTTPS, this may vary depending on how large you want
                to
                scale your project
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 2 - Create a WebXR application


                The next step in this process is creating your WebXR application this will involve creating 3D
                environments,
                objects, and interactions that users will experience in the virtual or augmented reality space. your
                application must be built using WebXR APIs and that it is compatible with the devices and browsers that
                you
                are targeting.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 3 - Deploy your WebXR application

                Once you've successfully created your WebXR application, you'll need to deploy it to your hosting
                provider
                of choice this involves uploading your application files and assets to your host provider's servers and
                configuring your domain and SSL certificate. Server-side rendering as well as caching may also need to
                be
                set up if you want to ensure your application runs smoothly and efficiently.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 4 - Running Test for your WebXR Application

                It is important before making your web application publicly available that you should test it, it can't
                be
                stressed enough that often people only test their work once or twice before shooting it out publicly.
                This
                is not only good practice but testing your WebXR application over and over again ensures everything is
                running properly and changes can be made prior, you could also get other users to interact with your web
                application before it's deployed live to see how they interact with your application.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 5 - Launching your WebXR application

                If confident that your WebXR application is properly working correctly, you can deploy it and make it
                publicly available. It is important to promote your application on social media as well as other
                relevant
                platforms to get feedback, you should also keep in mind to constantly monitor the performance of your
                application to gauge any issues or areas for improvement.

        <h1>Challenges faced with the usage of WebXR</h1>
        <p>Keep in mind whilst WebXR is an enriching technology with its ability to revolutionize our interaction with
            digital technology, it is still relatively new to the world of technology and whilst the field itself is
            evolving these are some problems developers face with its usage of this technology. Device compatibility,
            Performance, User experience, Development complexity, and Lack of standards. Despite the hardships faced
            with WebXR like any other technology one must understand for his/herself and be prepared to face these
            challenges by understanding them, only then can we develop engaging experiences that not only offer user
            value but help us dig deeper into virtual and augmented reality alike.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>What now?</h1>
        <p>What now? Although we haven't dived deeper into the nitty gritty of what this technology is truly capable of
            we have gained a bit of an understanding of what it is, how it works, how to deploy it, why it's important,
            and its challenges. I implore you to go out and explore on your own as well as do your research if this is
            something that intrigues you, to gain a bit more understanding and be somewhat versed on how to use this
            technology yourself. I encourage you to put what you have learned to practice, if possible and hey you could
            very well be on track to creating your first web-based virtual experience.</p>
